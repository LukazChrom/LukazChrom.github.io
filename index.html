			First: An important information,<br>
			if you did not trust my WebPage and denied my script (e.g Microsoft Edge) my hidden link and my humble JavaScript-Code will not work for you.<br>
			This is of course optional though. Yet IF you made a mistake while entering the password, you simply have to close the tab and re-open it.
		</h3>

		<p>
			Now some background information for this "Home-Page":<br>
			It would be very dishonest of me to deny that I am far from an "expert" programmer.<br>
			To be very honest though, from the voluminous knowledge I managed to obtain so far, I had to come to the conclusion that it anyway, effectively makes little sense<br>
			to dive too deeply into a specific form of programming unless it truly interests you OR it will become your duty in the form of employment.<br>
			Granted, perhaps this mindset is not exactly that of the “ideal-applicant” but the simple fact that the world of computing is at this point as enormous<br>
			as it is, looking at it in this light I guess this statement is, in a way, also an admittance to something probably much more important.<br>
			Namely the willingness to adapt, now that much I dare to claim to have. Honestly, I judge it as very unlikely to be able to solve some high'n'mighty<br>Binary-Tree-Problem, this humble webpage for example, it is most certainly nowhere near anything that could be considered a finished product BUT, that much I<br>one last time dare to claim, it is most certainly proof of a basic understanding.<br>
			For, to be honest, I have no need for a webpage, it was somewhat enjoyable though, to create it :D
