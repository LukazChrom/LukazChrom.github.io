			It is important to remember that you need a domain AND some host-server.<br>
			The domain is nothing but the Web-address and the host-server is simply<br>
			the computer that has to have it on it and constantly work in order to provide it,<br>
			when you wish for it to be provided that is.<br>
			It is WORTH noting that unfortunately it seems impossible to get a domain 100% free<br>
			UNLESS you use some tricks.<br>
			These tricks being for example to re-register your domain once a year<br>
			with a year seemingly being the time-frame with which the domain-providers usually work.<br>
			A very important thing to keep in mind here is what exactly a domain is in detail:<br>
			Because ACTUALLY you don't really need one (at least if you host your own server that is)<br>
			A domain is nothing but a re-translation of the IP-Address of your server.<br>
			For the IP-Address is what it all comes down to.<br>
			DNS stands for nothing else than DomainNameSystem fittingly.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Now if you wanted to be 100% self-sufficient and not use a domain-provider like FreeNom<br>
			Well then you are basically out of luck because if you REALLY wanted that you would have to<br>
			get into contact with the great Internet-Naming Overlords located in Los Angeles named ICANN<br>
			the non-profit-organization InternetCorprorationOFTHEAssigningOFNamesANDNummbers.<br>
			This is probably a significantly higher science and probably would cost even more.<br>
			So the tldr of this section be: Unless you literally rule the ICANN you WILL have to<br>
			yearly re-assign with a standing Domain-Provider that already kissed the behind of ICANN or you simply pay one way or another.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			When it comes to the Webhost-Provider there are once again quite a lot that want you to pay<br>
			but from beauTeaches I learned that you can also simply use GitHub for free which actually seems like an excellent choice.<br>
			Do not underestimate it though. You have to create a new Repository AND your "main"-html_Page NEEDS to be named 'index'.<br>
			Plus I would most certainly not assume it to be a good choice for an actually commercial website... just remember the tutorial of beauTeaches<br>
			I am too lazy to link it now but it is in your YT-tutorial-Playlist.
